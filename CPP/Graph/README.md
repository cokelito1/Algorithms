# Graph Algorithms

## Usage
All the Graph algorithms have the input as node quantity then 
edge quantity followed by a list of edge in the form of 
from to <weight>. Weight is optional as is only needed on weighted
graph algorithms.

### Prim Algorithm
Prim algorithm is useful to get the minimum spanning tree, it has a running
time of O(E + log V) with a fibonacci heap.
